TITLE: Metformin – NASH Strategic Review

Metformin was previously reviewed as a potential low-cost adjunct therapy in
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. While epidemiologic correlations were noted,
internal consensus was that metformin lacks sufficient mechanistic
differentiation to compete with FXR agonists and metabolic pathway agents.

Commercial concerns included generic status, lack of exclusivity,
and high evidentiary requirements for regulatory approval in NASH.
